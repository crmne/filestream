Filestream is a proof-of-concept application that implements asynchronous file uploading with server-side progress tracking in [Node.js][].

Unfortunately not all people use modern browsers. For this reason, tracking a file's upload progress using modern HTML and Javascript APIs, such as [HTML5's progress][html5-progress] or the [Progress Events API][progress-events], is often unfeasible. Filestream is a server-side solution that works with virtually any browser supported by [jQuery][].

It supports concurrent uploads, server-side upload progress, and concurrent field updates.
Its only dependencies are the [Express][] microframework, the [connect-form][] multipart form parsing middleware, and the [jade][] template engine.

[Node.js][] was chosen because it supports streaming file uploads.

Filestream is deployed at http://filestream.herokuapp.com/
